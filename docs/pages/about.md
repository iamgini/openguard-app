# DevOps Workshops by [techbeatly](https://www.techbeatly.com/)

We have received hundreds of requests and queries from community members about the PoCs and hands-on practices to learn DevOps and other technologies. We tried our best to advise and guide them with instructions and references. At some point we realised that it would be better if we could keep these instructions in a common place from where everyone can access and utilize them.

The practice instructions are meant for the individuals to practice at their own premises and we are not providing any lab environments here. However, we will try our best to include the instructions to create your own lab (locally or on cloud) or all the publicly available free labs.

## Contributions

If you are want to contribute, please submit workshops, feedback, topics, additional resources and updates via [issues](https://github.com/techbeatly/devops-workshop-support/issues/new?labels=question&title=Question:) in the support repo.
