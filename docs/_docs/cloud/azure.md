## Prepare Azure account

You need to create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and configure it before you start anything on this practices. Azure is giving $200 credit and a lot of free tier services for a new Azure account and you do not need to pay anything to learn using this free account. Make sure you are using only free tier usage of the resources.
